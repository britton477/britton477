### Hello there ðŸ––

I started my journey into the wide world of software development in AUG 2022 with Python to prove to my self it was possible, now im hooked.  

- ðŸŒ± I have gone on to learn about Ruby, PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS and API's, I am no master, but that wont stop me.  
- ðŸ“– I am currently expanding my knowledge on PHP as it is what I am using for a current project, but I am also learning about Django.    
- ðŸ’¬ Outside the world of tech, my fulltime job as a housing support worker for a charity takes a lot of my time, but you can also find me in the gym.  
- ðŸŽ¬ My favourite movie is Django Unchained, an absolute masterpiece from Quentin Tarantino.  
- ðŸ›« I enjoy traveling, although I havent been abroad since 2019 where I travelled solo across Cambodia and Thailand.  
- ðŸ¦Š You can follow my latest project on gitlabs --> https://gitlab.com/britton477
